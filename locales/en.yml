                   “Currency is the currency converter I always wanted to use.
                   The design is meant to be intuitive and easy to use, showing
                   incredible attention to typography at the same time. Every
                   currency is displayed in its own correct currency format and
                   with its currency symbol in the San Francisco typeface.
                   </p>

                   <p>
                   The aim of Currency was simplicity, not features. It has been
                   tested and revised throughout its entire development, with
                   the end goal of being easy to use by anyone of any age,
                   anywhere in the world.”
